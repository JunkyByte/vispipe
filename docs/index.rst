Welcome to VisPipe's documentation!
===================================

VisPipe will help simplify the process of building pipelines in python by providing you a convenient visualization that can be simply extended to custom operations.
By default VisPipe provides a number of Operational blocks you can use to build your pipeline but if do not suit your needs creating new block is easy, fast and painless.
